Chapter 1: The Waiting Room
The sun had just begun to set, casting a golden glow across the sky. Inside the peaceful room, the air was thick with a calm that only comes with certainty. The faint hum of a distant breeze played through the open window, and the soft murmur of voices mingled with the quiet rustle of pages turning in well-worn Bibles. The room, though small and unassuming, felt larger than life, as if it held the weight of many lifetimes.

This was the Departure Lounge.

At least, that’s what the attendants called it. But there was something different about this lounge—a deep, tranquil certainty in the hearts of its occupants. This was no ordinary waiting area, and for the elderly Christians who filled the seats, it was no ordinary time of waiting.

For the first time, Martha could almost feel the sense of departure—no longer something to dread, but something to look forward to. Her hands trembled lightly as she adjusted the brim of her wide sunhat. The wrinkles on her face were no longer signs of age but reminders of a life well lived, one filled with prayer, love, and joy in the Lord.

"I think it’s my time," she murmured softly, looking over at her friend, Edna, seated across from her.

Edna smiled warmly, her eyes twinkling with a light that belied her 87 years. "You’re not alone, Martha. We’re all here together, waiting for the same flight." Her voice was steady, but there was a lightness in it, as if she too was growing eager for the journey ahead.

The air around them seemed to shimmer, and for a moment, they both felt it—an unmistakable presence. It was the kind of presence that was unexplainable yet undeniable. It filled the room with peace, and though no words were spoken aloud, it was clear that they were in the presence of their Savior.

"Are you sure we’re really about to leave this world?" Martha asked, her voice trembling not with fear, but with anticipation. "I thought I had so much more to do, but now, it feels like it’s all coming together."

Edna chuckled softly, her hand resting on her chest as she reflected on her own journey. "There’s nothing left for us here, dear. Our race is run, and now it’s time for us to go home. Just as Paul said, 'For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain' (Philippians 1:21). We’ve lived for Him, and now, we go to be with Him."

A soft rustling from the other side of the room drew their attention. Elderly Samuel, hunched over with age yet sharp in mind, leaned forward in his chair, his Bible resting in his lap. His face held the same peaceful expression that had come over the others.

"You know," Samuel said in his deep, steady voice, "I used to think of death as something to be feared. But over the years, I’ve learned something different. When you’re walking with Jesus, death is just another step. It's like crossing from one place to another, from the familiar to the glory that awaits us." He paused, looking at each of them in turn. "It’s not a goodbye; it’s a ‘see you soon.’"

Martha nodded, feeling the weight of his words settle into her heart. Her mind wandered briefly to the Scriptures—the promises of the Father that had sustained her for so many years. "John 14:2-3," she whispered aloud. "In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am."

Edna leaned in, her voice full of joy. "Martha, we’ve been waiting for this day for so long. We’ve walked through valleys and climbed hills, trusting that He was with us every step. And now, we’re so close. The flight is almost here."

Martha could feel the joy rising in her heart as she looked out the window, imagining the streets of gold and the mansion Jesus had promised. She wasn’t afraid. In fact, she was eager. The thought of leaving behind this world full of trials and suffering seemed like nothing in comparison to the glory that awaited her. She thought about her own family—her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren—and though she would miss them, she knew that her real home was waiting for her, beyond the clouds.

This was not a time to mourn, but a time to rejoice. The journey to the Departure Lounge had been a long one, but it had been worth every step. Now, the moment had come. The flight was near.

Samuel chuckled again, breaking Martha from her reverie. "It’s funny," he said, "when I was younger, I was always so focused on doing more for God. But now, as I get closer to the end of my journey, I realize that it’s not about what we do—it’s about who we know. And I know Him. And that’s enough."

The others nodded in agreement, each one reflecting on their own walk with Christ, the comfort and joy that came with knowing their Savior intimately. They had fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith. And now, they were ready to step into eternity.

The attendant entered the room, smiling gently at the group. "Your flight is almost ready," he said softly, his voice a soothing balm. "Are you prepared to board?"

Martha looked around at her friends, her heart swelling with peace. She wasn’t afraid. She was ready.

"Yes," she said softly. "We’re ready."

And as the attendant smiled and began to lead them toward the gate, Martha could feel it—the unmistakable thrill of anticipation. The Departure Lounge was not a place of sorrow, but of joy. And her flight to be with Jesus Christ was about to begin.
