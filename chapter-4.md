#### Chapter 4: The Flight

The descent grew smoother, the vibrations in the plane gentle like a lullaby, coaxing them closer to the final destination. The clouds parted as the plane glided through the sky, revealing glimpses of something more radiant than anything Martha had ever seen. The golden light that shone through the clouds felt alive, pulsating with warmth and love. It was the glory of heaven.

As Martha looked out the window, she could hardly believe what she was seeing. It wasn’t just the beauty that awed her—it was the sense of peace that flooded her heart. For so many years, she had wondered what heaven would be like, and now, she could see it, feel it, and know it in the deepest parts of her soul. The beauty of the world on earth had always been a reflection of something greater, but this… this was the source.

"Look at that," Edna whispered, her voice filled with awe. "It’s more beautiful than anything we could have imagined."

Martha nodded, her eyes filling with tears. She had spent her life walking by faith, clinging to the promises of God. And now, she was seeing those promises come to life before her eyes.

Samuel, who had been quiet for a while, spoke again, his voice steady and filled with reverence. "Do you remember what Jesus said in John 14:3? 'And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.'"

"Yes," Martha responded, her voice thick with emotion. "I remember. I never fully understood what that meant, but now… now I do."

The plane was no longer just a vehicle—it was a sacred journey. Each moment, each second, was a reminder that they were leaving behind the old and entering into something far greater. The weight of their earthly lives had been shed, and now they were free, soaring on wings of joy and anticipation.

The attendant walked down the aisle once more, his serene presence bringing with it a sense of calm. He paused at each seat, giving the passengers a gentle nod, a silent acknowledgment that the flight was nearing its end.

"We are almost there," he said quietly. "Prepare your hearts. You are about to enter into the presence of the One who has called you home."

Martha’s heart raced as the words sank in. She was about to meet Jesus, the Savior who had carried her through every trial, every storm, and every challenge. She had walked with Him for so long, but now, she would see Him face-to-face.

The plane began its final descent, and Martha could hear the faint sounds of trumpets in the distance, as if the very heavens were rejoicing at their arrival. It wasn’t the sound of a distant trumpet, but something much closer, deep within her spirit. The sound of welcome. The sound of home.

Edna squeezed Martha’s hand. "Can you hear that? It’s the sound of the angels rejoicing."

Martha closed her eyes, and for a moment, she could almost see the heavenly host, their voices lifted in praise. The thought of being surrounded by the angels, praising God for His glory, filled her with a joy that was indescribable. She had longed for this moment, and now it was finally here.

"I can hear it," Martha said softly, a smile breaking across her face. "And I can feel it."

The plane continued its descent, gliding smoothly through the sky. The air grew warmer, and Martha could sense that the journey was coming to its final moment. They were getting closer to their eternal destination, to the city whose builder and maker was God Himself.

As the plane neared the landing strip, a sense of expectancy filled the air. Martha looked out the window one last time and saw the gates of heaven—gleaming, radiant, and wide open, welcoming them home. The streets of gold sparkled in the distance, and the river of life wound its way through the city, shining like crystal. And there, standing at the gate, was Jesus.

He stood with arms wide open, a welcoming smile on His face, ready to greet His beloved children.

Martha’s heart soared. This was the moment she had been waiting for all her life. The moment she would see her Savior face-to-face, the moment she would enter into His presence and hear the words she had longed to hear: "Well done, good and faithful servant."

And then, the plane touched down.

There was no jolt, no sudden impact, only a gentle landing that seemed to glide perfectly into place. The door opened, and the attendant motioned for them to disembark.

"This is it," Samuel said, his voice a mixture of awe and excitement. "Our journey has ended, but a new one is beginning."

One by one, the passengers rose from their seats, stepping into the light of eternity. They moved toward the door, hearts filled with joy, knowing that they were about to step into the presence of the One who had called them, loved them, and kept them through it all.

Martha took a deep breath and stepped forward, her hand still tightly clasped in Edna’s. As they walked down the aisle, the joy in her heart reached its peak. This was not just a destination—it was the beginning of forever. And as they stepped into the glorious light, Martha knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had arrived at her true home.

The angels sang, and the saints cheered. "Welcome home, child of God," they said.

And Martha, with tears in her eyes and a smile on her face, entered into the presence of Jesus Christ, her Savior and her King.
