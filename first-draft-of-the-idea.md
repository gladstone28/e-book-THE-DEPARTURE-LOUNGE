That sounds like a beautiful concept for an e-book! Here's a rough outline to help shape the story:

Title: The Departure Lounge
Introduction:

Set the tone by introducing the concept of the "Departure Lounge" as a metaphor for the final stage of life.
Use a peaceful, comforting atmosphere where elderly Christians are awaiting their final flight to heaven.
Emphasize the joy and excitement rather than fear or sorrow.
Chapter 1: The Waiting Room

Introduce the main character(s)â€”elderly Christians who are firm in their faith.
They are told they have entered the "Departure Lounge," a place of rest before their flight.
Focus on their joyful anticipation of joining Jesus Christ. Draw parallels to the peace that Jesus spoke of in the Bible, like John 14:2-3.
Chapter 2: Memories of the Journey

Characters reflect on their lives and the faithfulness of God throughout their journeys.
Include biblical references like Psalm 23:4 ("Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil") to show how their walk with Christ has been fulfilling.
Chapter 3: The Boarding Pass

Symbolically, the boarding pass represents salvation through Christ.
The characters receive a boarding pass with their name written by God, confirming their place in heaven.
Draw from Philippians 3:20 ("But our citizenship is in heaven") to affirm that their future is secure in Christ.
Chapter 4: The Flight

The elderly characters get ready for the flight, fully prepared and filled with joy.
Use flight metaphors to describe their transition from life to death, emphasizing that they are about to meet Jesus.
Reference 2 Corinthians 5:8 ("We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord").
Chapter 5: The Final Journey

The journey begins as they board the heavenly flight, with each character feeling the peace that surpasses understanding.
Their joy is reflected in passages like Revelation 21:4 ("He will wipe every tear from their eyes").
Convey the excitement that their destination is heaven, where they will experience eternal peace with Christ.
Conclusion: Home at Last

The characters arrive at their heavenly destination, greeted with open arms by Jesus.
Finish with a sense of fulfillment, joy, and celebration as they enter into eternal rest, using 2 Timothy 4:7-8 to remind readers of the ultimate reward for a faithful life.
