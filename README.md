#### The Departure Lounge:

**The title and idea behind this book**

The title should be "The Departure Lounge" and idea behind this book is that elderly Christians who are firm in their faith should rejoice at being told that they are waiting in the Departure Lounge. The story should draw on biblical themes. The story should be exciting and should bring out the point that as people get older and nearer to dying, they should be happy of being with Jesus Christ after a joyful flight
