#### Chapter 5: The Final Journey

Martha stepped through the gate, her heart overflowing with joy, and immediately she was enveloped in light—the kind of light that didn’t burn, but warmed every part of her being. It was as if she were bathed in the purest love, a love that had been waiting for her since the beginning of time.

As she stood there, she couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of it all. The streets were paved with gold that shimmered with an otherworldly glow, and the air was filled with the sweet fragrance of flowers that she could not name but instinctively knew were beyond anything she had ever imagined. The sound of music—voices raised in praise, harmonious and perfect—seemed to come from everywhere, filling her heart with an indescribable peace.

This was it. This was home.

She took a few steps forward, and Edna was right beside her, her hand still holding Martha’s as they both walked together. They didn’t need to speak. Their hearts understood. Both women, now on the other side of the veil, were walking side by side into eternity, their eyes set on the one thing that mattered most—the face of Jesus.

As they walked, Martha could hear the laughter of children, the voices of loved ones who had gone before them, and the beautiful sound of worship that seemed to fill every corner of heaven. There were no shadows here, no sorrow, no pain. Only joy, only peace.

And then, ahead of them, she saw Him. Jesus.

He stood in the midst of the glory, His presence radiating a warmth that filled every part of her. His face was filled with compassion, love, and welcome. His eyes, so full of grace, locked onto hers, and she felt a rush of emotions flood over her—joy, gratitude, awe. This was the moment she had been waiting for, the moment she had longed for her entire life.

"Come, Martha," He said, His voice the most beautiful sound she had ever heard. "Welcome home."

Tears welled up in her eyes, and without thinking, she ran toward Him, her heart in her throat. She didn’t care about anything else in that moment—there was nothing else but Him, the Savior, the one who had given everything for her, who had made it possible for her to stand here in this moment of glory.

Jesus opened His arms, and as she reached Him, she fell into His embrace, feeling the warmth and the safety of His love surround her.

"I’ve waited for you," He whispered, His voice tender and full of compassion. "I’ve watched you grow, Martha. I’ve seen you trust Me. And now, you are home."

Martha could barely speak. The overwhelming joy and peace were beyond words. All she could do was hold onto Him, knowing that she was finally home, in the place that had always been her true home. Heaven was not just a place; it was being with Jesus, and now, she was there.

Edna stood beside them, watching the scene unfold. Her eyes were filled with tears of joy as she, too, experienced the same peace. She had longed for this moment, just as Martha had, and now they were both here together, in the arms of their Savior.

"This is what we were made for," Edna said softly, her voice filled with awe. "To be with Him forever."

Martha nodded, her heart full of peace. "I never understood how real this was. I always thought of it as something for the future, something far away. But now, it’s all so real. It’s more than I could have ever imagined."

Jesus smiled down at her, His face full of love. "I know. I’ve always known, Martha. I’ve always been with you, and now, you are here, where you belong. There is no more pain, no more fear, no more death. Only life—eternal life."

As the two women stood there, basking in the presence of Jesus, they could feel the sense of home that filled every part of them. Heaven wasn’t just a place; it was a relationship—a relationship with the one who had created them, loved them, and brought them here.

And as they stood in that sacred moment, the reality of eternity settled in. There would be no more goodbyes, no more sorrow, only the joy of being in His presence forever.

A voice rang out in the distance, full of joy and exultation. "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God." (Revelation 21:3)

Martha closed her eyes, the truth of those words sinking deep into her heart. This was the fulfillment of everything she had lived for, everything she had hoped for. She was home, and she was not alone. She was with her Savior, and all the saints of God would dwell together in glory forever.

And in that moment, Martha knew that the final journey, the journey that had begun so many years ago, had truly come to its end. The flight had taken her from earth to heaven, from pain to peace, from the fleeting to the eternal. And it was all worth it.

She looked at Jesus once more, a smile breaking across her face. "Thank You, Lord," she whispered. "Thank You for bringing me home."

Jesus smiled back at her, His love for her radiating in every glance, every gesture. "Welcome home, Martha," He said again, His voice filled with joy. "Well done, good and faithful servant."

And in that moment, she knew—this was just the beginning. The beginning of eternity, where she would live forever in the presence of the One who had created her, redeemed her, and called her home.
