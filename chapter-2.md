#### Chapter 2: Memories of the Journey

As they made their way toward the gate, the soft murmur of voices was replaced by a stillness that filled the air. The attendants guided them down a hallway lined with soft golden lights, their footsteps echoing softly. The lounge behind them seemed to fade away, becoming a distant memory, and before them stretched a path that led toward something greater than they had ever imagined.

Martha walked slowly, taking in every moment, savoring the last breaths of her earthly life. As they reached the entrance, she paused, her hand resting on the doorframe, and looked back one last time at the room they had just left.

"Do you remember when we first met, Edna?" Martha asked, her voice filled with nostalgia.

Edna smiled warmly, her eyes twinkling with the joy of remembering. "How could I forget? You were always the one with the best stories—especially the ones about your years in the mission field. I think you taught all of us what it truly means to live by faith."

Martha nodded thoughtfully, her heart swelling with gratitude for the experiences that had shaped her journey. "It wasn’t always easy, though. There were times when I questioned whether I was doing enough for the Lord. I remember feeling exhausted and wondering if I was truly making a difference."

Edna placed her hand gently on Martha’s shoulder. "But you were. And you didn’t need to be perfect—God didn’t ask us for perfection, just obedience."

Martha smiled at the truth of Edna's words. She thought back to the early days when she had felt the Lord’s call on her life so strongly, when she was eager to serve, unsure of where the path would lead, but trusting that He would guide her every step of the way.

And indeed, He had.

"Remember the time we went to that small village?" Martha asked, her voice warm with fondness. "It was only a small group of us, but we saw so many lives changed in that place."

Edna laughed softly. "How could I forget? You convinced all of us to hike up that mountain in the pouring rain to visit the sick. I thought we were going to lose our shoes in the mud!"

Both women chuckled, their laughter light and carefree, filled with memories of the work they had done together for the Kingdom. It hadn’t always been glamorous or easy, but it had always been worth it.

"And we saw the fruit of our labor," Martha continued. "The woman we prayed for, the one who couldn’t walk—she stood up and walked after we prayed. It was a moment I will never forget."

Edna’s eyes filled with tears. "The look on her face—how could anyone deny that the Lord was with us? It wasn’t us; it was Him."

Martha nodded, reflecting on all the times when she had seen God work through the humble obedience of His servants. Over the years, she had come to understand that the true measure of a life well lived wasn’t in the grand gestures but in the quiet faithfulness of everyday moments.

"You know," Martha said, her voice soft, "I spent so much of my life trying to measure up, thinking I had to do more, be more. But looking back, I see it so clearly now. It was never about my works, but about trusting Him. I did what I could, and God did the rest."

Edna squeezed her hand. "And look at you now. You’ve done more than you ever knew. You planted seeds in so many lives, Martha. Those seeds are still growing, even now."

The group reached the gate, and the attendant, who had been quietly walking beside them, gave them a reassuring smile. "You are ready to board," he said gently. "The journey that began long ago is coming to its beautiful conclusion."

Martha felt a calm peace settle in her heart, but also a deep sense of excitement. This was it—the final leg of the journey. She had walked with God for so many years, and now, the time had come to finally enter His presence.

But before they stepped onto the flight, Martha turned to look at the others in the group. Samuel, now standing at the front, was looking out over the horizon, his face serene.

"I used to fear this moment," Samuel said, turning toward them. "But the longer I’ve walked with God, the more I realize that this is not an end but a new beginning. As Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:1, ‘For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.’"

His words echoed in the hearts of everyone around him. They had walked their earthly paths with Christ, and now they were about to step into the eternal house He had promised them.

"I’ve lived a long life," Samuel continued, "but I don’t feel old anymore. I feel young in Christ, excited about what lies ahead."

Edna nodded. "Yes, it’s not about our age. It’s about the promise of life with Him forever."

Martha felt a swelling in her chest as she reflected on all the promises of God, promises that had sustained her for so long. She thought of the countless hours spent reading the Bible, of the quiet times of prayer, of the moments when she had felt the Holy Spirit draw near.

And now, at last, she was about to see it all come to fruition.

She turned to Edna, a smile breaking across her face. "Do you know, Edna, I’ve often thought that when we get to heaven, there won’t be a 'goodbye'—just a 'welcome home.' We’ll never part from Him again."

Edna’s eyes shone as she grasped Martha’s hand tightly. "And we’ll never part from each other, either."

With that, the doors to the flight opened, and the group stepped forward, their hearts filled with the joy of knowing they were about to be in the presence of the One who had loved them from the beginning. The journey that had started long ago was almost over, but their ultimate destination was just beginning.

They boarded the flight with eager hearts, each one filled with the anticipation of what awaited them on the other side—eternity with Jesus.
