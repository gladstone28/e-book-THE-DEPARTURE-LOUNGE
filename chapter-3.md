#### Chapter 3: The Boarding Pass

The moment Martha stepped onto the plane, she felt an overwhelming sense of peace, like she was finally exactly where she was meant to be. The plane was unlike anything she had ever seen, a beautiful vessel of light and tranquility, with seats arranged in neat rows, each space filled with a comforting warmth.

The attendant, who had guided them through the Departure Lounge, handed them their boarding passes, each one inscribed with a name—their names, written in script as delicate as the wings of a butterfly.

Martha held her pass in her hand, her eyes gazing down at the words. "Martha Dawson," it read. "Boarding for Eternal Life."

She couldn’t help but smile. It felt so… final. Yet, not final in the way she had once thought. There was no fear of death here, no anxiety about what lay ahead. This was the promise fulfilled—the moment she had longed for, for so many years. Heaven, her eternal home, was just a boarding gate away.

"Look at this," Edna said softly from beside her, holding her own pass with trembling hands. "It’s like a ticket to a place we’ve always known, but never quite seen."

"That’s because we’ve been walking by faith," Samuel interjected from across the aisle, his voice filled with warmth and wisdom. "And now, we’re about to see with our own eyes the promise that God gave us."

As they all took their seats, the plane began to move, its engines humming with a quiet strength, like a gentle breeze on a calm day. There was no fear, no turbulence—only a deep, abiding peace. This was the flight they had waited for all their lives.

Martha closed her eyes for a moment, allowing herself to bask in the comfort of knowing that everything she had worked for, everything she had longed for, was within reach. She had given so much of herself—her time, her energy, her love—but now, she understood that it was all part of God’s perfect plan. She had run the race, fought the good fight, and kept the faith. And now, she would be with Him forever.

"Do you remember 1 Corinthians 15:52?" Edna asked, her voice filled with awe. " ‘In a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.’"

Martha smiled, remembering how many times she had read those words over the years. "Yes, I do. It’s amazing, isn’t it? All the struggles we’ve faced—our tears, our heartaches—will be gone in the blink of an eye. And we’ll be changed. We’ll be made new."

The plane continued its journey through the sky, rising higher and higher, gliding smoothly into the unknown. Martha looked out the window, her heart filled with anticipation. The clouds stretched out before her, and though she couldn’t see the destination yet, she knew that it was just beyond the horizon.

They were nearing heaven.

"This is it," Samuel said, his voice low and full of wonder. "This is the flight we’ve all been waiting for. No more sickness, no more pain, no more sorrow. Just peace, joy, and the presence of the Lord."

Martha nodded, her eyes closing briefly as she whispered a prayer of thanksgiving. "Thank You, Lord, for Your grace, for Your faithfulness, for bringing me to this moment. I have longed to see Your face, and now, I will."

She could almost hear the soft echo of Jesus’ words in her heart: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28)

And as the plane soared higher into the sky, Martha felt the weight of the world fall away. All that was left was the certainty of what awaited her: eternal rest in the arms of her Savior.

Edna, sitting beside her, grasped her hand gently. "We’re almost there, Martha," she said, her voice full of peace. "Almost home."

The words filled Martha’s heart with a warmth she couldn’t describe. Home. Yes, this had always been home. The journey on earth had just been a brief stop—a waiting room, a departure lounge, but the destination was always Heaven.

Her heart swelled with joy as she thought about what awaited them: streets of gold, the river of life, and, above all, the face of Jesus—radiant, loving, and full of grace. To be with Him—that was the true meaning of life.

In that moment, the flight took on new meaning. It wasn’t just a physical journey. It was a spiritual one, a journey that would bring them closer to the Lord than they had ever been before.

The sound of the engine shifted, and the plane began to descend. The clouds outside grew denser, but instead of feeling anxiety, Martha felt an overwhelming peace. She was ready. They were all ready.

As the flight continued its descent, the attendant’s voice echoed softly through the intercom, a gentle reminder of the ultimate truth: "This is your final approach. Prepare for landing."

Martha held tightly to her boarding pass, the words etched on it now more real than ever. "Boarding for Eternal Life." It was a promise she had carried with her all her life, and now, she was about to step into it fully.

And so, as the plane glided toward its final destination, Martha whispered one last prayer: "Thank You, Jesus, for bringing me home."
