#### Chapter 13: The Eternal Reward

As Martha stood in the presence of Jesus, surrounded by the splendor of heaven and the eternal song of praise, she felt a sense of fulfillment that was beyond words. This was the culmination of a life lived in faith, a life that had been marked by trust in God's promises. She had fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith. And now, she was experiencing the reward that had been promised to her.

Her heart swelled as she thought of the scriptures that had sustained her throughout her life. The words of God’s promises, the assurance of His love, and the hope of eternal life had been her guide. And now, she was living those promises, fully realized in the presence of her Savior.

“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:3)

Martha had always known that the kingdom of heaven was not just a future hope, but a present reality for those who walked in faith. Now, in heaven, she experienced the fullness of that kingdom—God’s reign and His eternal love, in perfect communion with His people.

As she walked through the heavenly streets, she marveled at the words of Jesus from John 14:2-3: “My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.”

She was finally in the place He had prepared for her. She had made the journey from faith to fulfillment, and now, she would spend eternity with her Savior in the place He had prepared for her. It was a place of perfect rest, perfect peace, and perfect joy—because she was with Him.

Looking around, she saw so many others who had followed the same path. They were all united in one thing: their love for Jesus, their Savior, who had called them home.

And as she reflected on the scriptures that had guided her, Martha thought of 2 Timothy 4:7-8: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.”

The crown of righteousness was not just a reward for her—it was a reward for all who had trusted in the Lord, all who had longed for His appearing. She wasn’t alone in this reward. She was part of a great cloud of witnesses who had kept the faith, and together, they would share in the eternal joy of being with Jesus.

“Here I am, Lord,” Martha whispered softly, her heart full of gratitude. “I am here, where You promised me I would be. With You. Forever.”

Jesus smiled at her, His eyes full of love and grace. “You have been faithful, Martha. Now, enter into the joy of your Lord.”

In that moment, Martha felt the weight of those words settle deep within her. The joy of the Lord was her strength, her peace, and her eternal reward. And this joy would never end.

She thought again of Revelation 21:4: “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”

All the tears, all the mourning, and all the pain of this earthly life were gone. In their place was a joy so deep, so rich, that nothing could ever take it away. Heaven was a place of eternal healing, eternal joy, and eternal peace, where nothing could ever harm or separate them from the love of God.

And then, as the beauty of heaven surrounded her, Martha thought of those still on earth—the ones she had left behind. The family and friends who had shared in her life, who had prayed for her, who had loved her. She knew they were not lost to her. She knew that one day, in God’s perfect timing, they would join her here, in this place of eternal rest.

Her thoughts turned to them, and she prayed for their peace, their strength, and their faith. She prayed that they, too, would experience the joy and peace that she now knew in fullness. And she trusted that, in time, God would bring them here, just as He had brought her.

Martha felt the deep comfort of God’s presence, the assurance that His plan was perfect, that His timing was perfect, and that His love was perfect. And as she stood in the glory of heaven, surrounded by saints and angels, she knew that her journey was complete.

Her faith had been made sight. Her hope had been fulfilled. And now, she was home. Forever.

#### Epilogue: The Final Departure


As Martha stood before the throne of God, her heart filled with peace, she understood the fullness of God’s promise to all who trust in Him. The Departure Lounge had not been the end—it had been the beginning of eternity. And she had made that final journey, crossing from life into eternal life, from faith into fulfillment.

The journey that began with a longing for heaven had come to its completion in the arms of Jesus. And now, in the beauty of eternity, Martha was home.

“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39)

This was the greatest truth of all. In Christ, she had found her eternal home. And nothing would ever take that away.
